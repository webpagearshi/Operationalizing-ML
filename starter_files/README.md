# Operationalizing Machine Learning

Project Overview: In this project we have used the Bank Marketing Dataset which I have downloaded from the link provided in the project information.
In the project I have used Azure to configure a cloud based machine learning production model, deployed it and then consumed it. I have also created, published and consumed a pipeline using Python SDK.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
