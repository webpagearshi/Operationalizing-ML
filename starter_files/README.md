# Operationalizing Machine Learning

Project Overview: In this project we have used the Bank Marketing Dataset which I have downloaded from the link provided in the project information.
In the project I have used Azure to configure a cloud based machine learning production model, deployed it and then consumed it. I have also created, published and consumed a pipeline using Python SDK.
